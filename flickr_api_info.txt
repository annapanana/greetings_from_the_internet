 If your application stays under 3600 queries per hour across the whole key (which means the aggregate of all the users of your integration), you'll be fine. If we detect abuse on your key, we will need to expire the key, or turn it off, in order to preserve the Flickr API functionality for others (including us!). We also track usage on other factors as well to ensure no API user abuses the system.


Search and localized calls take more CPU cycles than simple data lookups and so they may take more time to execute. Also, keep an eye out for the "extras" parameters availability in the API queries which may help reduce how many calls you need to make.

Your application can cache API results and images for up to 24 hrs to help reduce API load
